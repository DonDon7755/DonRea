# Sound Alert Files

This directory contains sound alert files for different severity levels:

- `alert_critical.wav` - Used for critical/high severity alerts (high risk ransomware detected)
- `alert_warning.wav` - Used for medium severity alerts (suspicious files/behavior)
- `alert_info.wav` - Used for low severity/informational alerts

These files are played when alerts are triggered in the desktop application.
